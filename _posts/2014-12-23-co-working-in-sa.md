Work has changed, work spaces are changing too. South Africa has tapped into the local trend of co-working. OPEN is not alone in its endeavour to create a shared working environment for entrepreneurs and professionals. 

In recent years, quite a number of co-working spaces were established. Specifically in Cape Town, but also in Joburg and some other cities like Durban. The nature, focus and facilities of these spaces vary quite a bit.

OPEN has developed its own approach in this rapidly developing landscape, focusing on high quality facilities and high speed internet, and linking entrepreneurs to corporates.

To help you find your way, we selected some sites and links that might help you:
