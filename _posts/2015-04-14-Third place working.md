## Third place working

Why the work place still matters in the digital age

Regus conducted a large-scale study on third place working around major cities and close to major transport hubs (New York, London, Paris, Mumbai & Hong Kong).

The analysis identifies three high-level reasons, apart from convenient access, why people choose to work in a third work place:

1.	Facilitating productive work
2.	Safeguarding work-life balance
3.	Easing work-family interface
