The work of Steven Johnson was a major source of inspiration when we started OPEN. In 2010 he wrote the book *Where good ideas come from: the natural history of innovation*. 

For the book, Johnson researched the origin and development of great ideas: What kind of environment breeds them? What sparks the flash of brilliance? How do we generate the breakthrough technologies that push forward our lives, our society, our culture? 

Steven Johnson's answers are revelatory as he identifies the seven key patterns behind genuine innovation, and traces them across time and disciplines. From Darwin and Freud to the halls of Google and Apple, Johnson investigates the innovation hubs throughout modern time and pulls out the approaches and commonalities that seem to appear at moments of originality.

The book is worth reading. For those who prefer the short version and prefer listening above reading, there is the TED talk Johnson gave: <iframe src="https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from.html" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
