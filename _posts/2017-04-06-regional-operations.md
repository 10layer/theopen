## Summary
We are looking for someone with hospitality experience, a can do attitude, and a knack for dealing with people to manage operations. First at Workshop17 and then regional as more spaces go live in the coming year.

## Work context
Amazing things are being created every day at OPEN and we make sure the people who create these have everything they need. We provide fun workspaces in which professionals and entrepreneurs can thrive. And in which they feel at home and part of a diverse community.

We offer the whole range: public café workspace, hot desking, team spaces, serviced offices and event spaces. We keep our workspaces running smoothly and on a path towards creating a better, more connected South Africa. We are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to creative spaces that support inclusive networking and innovation. 

## The job
We need someone to oversee that all operations run smoothly. Someone who problem solves with the team onsite and together with them strives to continuously improve the customer experience and day to day operations. Someone who supports and builds the team performance and spirit. Not as a bossy boss, but in the spirit of coworking. Someone who builds and maintains strong relations with key stakeholders in our ecosystem.

The job starts out as operations manager at Workshop17, our space in the Waterfront. In course of the coming year the job will become regional, overseeing 3 or 4 spaces in different areas in the Western Cape.

## The job candidate we seek
You are a creative, organized customer service professional, who takes pride in seeing things run smoothly and efficiently. You are responsible for leading, monitoring and controlling all portfolio facilities activities, with a focus on building operations, vendor management, financial and team management

You go out of your way to make sure your guests are not just satisfied, but inspired and enabled beyond their expectations. You provide the highest standards of excellence but you aren't afraid to have fun with your job, and bring an enthusiasm, dedication and a collaborative spirit to build and maintain office spaces that facilitate cutting edge innovation and empowering networking opportunities. Off course, as everywhere, issues arise and mistakes happen, which you solve generously and with tact.

You will control the budgets and associated costs, manage outsourced teams, and will be responsible for all aspects of the operational and strategic facilities management services. You will also build strong and enduring relationships.

You support and inspire our operations teams of inquisitive and energetic hospitality and facilities professionals to constantly make our shared spaces a great place to come to work everyday.
