Fundamental changes are happening. This Huffington post article summarizes five disruptions:

1. Corporate loyalty is dead
2. Social networks have changed how we hire
3. The best talent isn't necessarily within driving distance
4. Businesses of one will be the new normal
5. Work is no longer a place

Huffington Post sees cubicle farms giving way to co-working spaces, business suits and pumps will be replaced with jeans and Converse sneakers, and rush hour will feature fewer clogged highways.
