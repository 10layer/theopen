blurb: This is my first post done gazing out over the rolling midlands hills. Using a combination of Git, Jekyll, text editor and a Markdown Cheatsheet we can now post thoughts to the Though section of the OPEN website with ease. The system does all the heavy lifting.

What a pleasure to be able to easily post a thought - simply create a simple text file using <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links" target="_blank">Markdown</a>

Then save the file and use git add, git commit and git push to merge the file with the master git repository online and bingo the the thought is live.

Oh and one more thing to associate an image to the banner and to the Thought simply add the image to the /img/thought/ dir and Jekyll will re size the image for the different requirements on the site. Jekyll takes the text file and based on the categories creates an SEO rich url for the thought - both on the Though index page and a dedicated thought detail page.

What a Thought and all thanks to Jason to make all the magic happen.
