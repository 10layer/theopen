blurb: This is my first post done gazing out over the rolling hills of the Midlands in KZN. Using a combination of Git, Jekyll, text editor and a Markdown Cheatsheet we can now post thoughts to the Thought section of the OPEN website with ease. The system does all the heavy lifting...

What a pleasure to be able to easily post a thought - simply create a simple text file using Markdown.

Then save the file and use git add, git commit and git push to merge the file with the master git repository online and bingo the thought is live.

Oh and one more thing, to associate an image with the banner and to the Thought simply add the image to the /img/thought/ dir and Jekyll will resize the image for the different requirements of the site. Jekyll then takes the text file and based on the categories, creates an SEO rich url for the thought - both on the Thought index page and on a dedicated thought detail page.

Thanks to Jason for making the magic happen.
