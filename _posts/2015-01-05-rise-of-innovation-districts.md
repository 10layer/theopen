The way innovation is done and being thought of has changed over the years. We used to think that innovation happens in highly secretive and specialised Research & Development departments of large companies, where highly skilled researchers and developers develop new technologies and solutions.

The last decades have shown that this view is outdated and concept like ‘open innovation’, ‘rapid prototyping’, ‘innovation networks’, ‘smart cities’ have come up. The central idea behind this is that openness, sharing, and proximity of various disciplines and end users are conducive to innovation.

This gave rise to what are called “innovation districts’. These districts are geographic areas where leading-edge institutions and companies cluster and connect with start-ups, business incubators and accelerators. They are also physically compact, transit-accessible, and technically-wired and offer mixed-use housing, office, and retail.

OPEN’s new developments, at the V&A Waterfront and at Wits, are examples of this. It is not about co-working as such. Co-Working is just a component of an eco-system in which a multitude of entrepreneurs, academics, researchers, developers, corporates are brought together to work on innovation.
