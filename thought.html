				<p>Work has changed, work spaces are changing too. South Africa has tapped into the local trend of co-working. OPEN is not alone in its endeavour to create a shared working environment for entrepreneurs and professionals. 
In recent years, quite a number of co-working spaces were established. Specifically in Cape Town, but also in Joburg and some other cities like Durban. The nature, focus and facilities of these spaces vary quite a bit.
OPEN has developed its own approach in this rapidly developing landscape, focusing on high quality facilities and high speed internet, and linking entrepreneurs to corporates.

<p>To help you find your way, we selected some sites and links that might help you:
