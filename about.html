					<h2><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i>The way we work has changed. Workplaces need to change too.</h2>
					<p>Many of us are autonomous professionals. We operate as free agents, in networks or as part of small companies. The kind of work we do doesn’t fit into cramped, stifling cubicles, our home offices don’t have the social interaction we crave, and coffee shops are too noisy and not private enough.</p>

					<p>We need a flexible office space where we can be at our most creative and productive.We need somewhere we can be comfortable, get our work done efficiently and be inspired. That place is OPEN.</p>

					<p>Let your environment affect your creative thinking and productivity in a unique way</p>

							<h4>KTechnoserve Company</h4>
							<blockquote>We recently held a 3 day workshop at OPEN, Maboneng. From the word go all the staff were efficient, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. In particular Margaret was a great point person and accommodating to the very last second. All of the participants were dealt with in a professional and courteous manner, we had a number of international and national participants and each one was suitably impressed with OPEN. A wonderful inner city space that is both dynamic and business orientated. Well done to all at OPEN!”

							<h4>FOREFRONT CONSULTING</h4>
							<blockquote>The space is full of creative, innovative start-ups and people who have vision. I instantly had an amazing office space and awesome ‘co-workers’. I’ve fallen in love with the faces I see every day and I’ve been able to collaborate with people and businesses that wouldn’t have crossed my path in my isolated office back in Parkhurst.</blockquote>

							<h4>ATTIBILITY</h4>
							<blockquote>OPEN provides an alternative space to really explore new thinking in the creative and business arena. The OPEN concept has broken the mould of how any business should operate and has created a very exciting alternative for the future of work…. Collaboration, not competition, creates growth for all…!</blockquote>

							<h4>BEYOND ABILITY</h4>
							<blockquote>I am a very simple person with a simple concept and OPEN has given me just that "simple" no frills or fuss as you work your bottom line.</blockquote>

							<h4>UNILEVER</h4>
							<blockquote>What a privilege it was to be one of the first companies to use OPEN at the Main Change for the Unilever Leadership conference. The thrust of the conference was the magic of technology across all digital platforms. We are sure OPEN will continue to attract the businesses that wish to be recognised as trendsetters – and salute you for pioneering this project – and recognising the potential of placing the OPEN environment within the heart of South Africa’s major city.</blockquote>

							<h4>ABSA Bank</h4>
							<blockquote>The workshop went off very well, and the venue – the hospitality, warmth and professionalism of the people who work at The Open – contributed to our workshop success. Margaret, in particular, you were a star in ensuring that we were well taken of at all times – from the cleanliness of the facilities, to the fresh food and the drinks, to immediate support on IT and similar. I’ve also had very good feedback from other attendants so thank you very much. 
 
We’ll definitely be returning to The Open in the near future.
