					<h2><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i>The way we work has changed. Workplaces need to change too.</h2>
					<p>Many of us are autonomous professionals. We operate as free agents, in networks or as part of small companies. The kind of work we do doesn’t fit into cramped, stifling cubicles, our home offices don’t have the social interaction we crave, and coffee shops are too noisy and not private enough.</p>

					<p>We need a flexible office space where we can be at our most creative and productive.We need somewhere we can be comfortable, get our work done efficiently and be inspired. That place is OPEN.</p>

					<p>OPEN stretches your mind to the possibilities of what your ‘office’ can become. Let your environment affect your creative thinking and productivity beneficially and uniquely.</p>
