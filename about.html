					<h2><i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i>The way we work has changed. Workplaces need to change too.</h2>
					<p>Many of us are autonomous professionals: we operate as free agents, in networks or as part of small companies. The kind of work we do doesn’t fit into stifling cubicles, our home offices don’t have the social interaction we crave, and coffee shops are too noisy and not private enough. </p>

					<p>We need a flexible office space where we can be at our most creative and productive.We need somewhere we can be comfortable, get our work done efficiently and be inspired to create. That place is OPEN.</p>

					<p>OPEN stretches your mind to the possibilities of what your ‘office’ can become. Let your environment affect your creative thinking and productivity in the most unique and beneficial manner.</p>

					<h2><i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i>We build our philosophy on the following metaphors</h2>
					<h4>A Coral Reef in the City</h4>
					<p>Coral reefs provide the fertile ground for an incredibly rich and diverse ecosystem. The reef is home to many colourful species, is bustling with activity, and is open, without any walls. We created OPEN to be a coral reef for ideas, where minds can meet and be inspired by the city. OPEN offers fertile ground for new ideas and for making these come to life.</p>

					<h4>A gym for work</h4>
					<p>Access, flexibility and sharing are replacing ownership. Like a gym, OPEN offers everything you need for you to use and enjoy without having to buy and maintain it. It offers you abundance and quality at a level that is not achievable on your own but very accessible when you share.</p>

					<h2>Pillars</h2>
					<h3>Sharing and inspiring</h3>
					<p>Sharing creates more for everyone: more facilities, more flexibility, more ideas, more inspiration, more quality.</p>
					<h3>Comfort and flexibility</h3>
					<p>OPEN should be easy, simple, generous and adaptive to your needs.</p>
					<h3>Transparency</h3>
					<p>There should be no surprises: no extra bills month end, clear packages and no hidden cost.</p>
					<h3>Aesthetical</h3>
					<p>Workspaces should be beautiful and make you feel good.</p>
